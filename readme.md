# Multitouch Fabric

[![License][license-img]][license-url]

The capstone project of Janette Hernandez (Electrical Engineering BSc) and Maria Contreras (Electrical Engineering BSc), a smart fabric that can respond to touch input.

The Multitouch Fabric is based on a design composed of several materials. 
These materials consist of: 
                          - Resistive Thread
                          - Non-Conductive Thread
                          - Neoprene
                          - Eeonyx 
                          - Perfboards
                          - Adafruit METRO Mini
The design consists of three different layers. In order to distinguish between all three layers, we will call the bottom layer “Rows”, middle layer “Eeonyx”, and the top layer “Columns”.
The Rows are composed of 4, 4 ½ inch rows of conductive thread facing up with non-conductive thread facing below. 
                     



To showcase the project [Alain Galvan (Computer Science MSc)](https://twitter.com/alainxyz) developed a visualizer program for the project.
